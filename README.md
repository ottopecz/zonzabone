Zonzabone
=========

Domain-specific JavaScript framework to support hierarchical MVC.
The idea behind it is extending/enhancing the existing DOM so it's recommended for HTML+ or hybrid applications.
Not recommended however for single-page apps.

Some of the cool features:
  * Real privacy
  * True controllers
  * Dumb views
  * Asynchronous pubsub
  * Every zonzabone object is a promise (Nice for asynchronous testing)
  
If you're a fan of separating business and display logic it's worth to take a look. Although the views resembles
to Backbone views they can be kept very stupid which is great for separating application logic so that can be unit-tested
very easily.

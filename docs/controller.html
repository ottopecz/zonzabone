<h1>Controller</h1>
<article>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>There is a difference between block controllers and plain controllers.
        <strong>Block controllers</strong> are loaded by a parent controller and they always have a piece of dom element which they break down and pass to one or more views.
        <strong>Plain controllers</strong> are usually instantiated manually (unlike block controllers) and they are responsible for a relatively small part of a block.
        It's a good practice that the dynamically created dom is controlled by plain controllers.
        In this case you don't need pass dom to the controllers but rather the controlled views will create that.
        Also it's possible that a plain controller doesn't control any views but does something else.</p>
</article>
<article  id="init">
    <h2>init <span>(method)</span></h2>
    <code>controller.init(options)</code>
    <p>Initializes the controller. If model and/or view are passed in the arguments <strong>init</strong> will create model and/or view members for the controller.
        if model and/or view was created beforehand they going to get overridden.
        <strong>Init</strong> is also able to create model and/or view if they were not defined in the factory previously or passed as an argument.
        <strong>Init</strong> will grab every passed argument and create a basic model using them. Array of objects are special they will be wrapped up in a collection and put into the model.
        Also if there is any dom element(el) passed to the factory init will automatically create a view around that. If there are browser events defined in the <a href="#events">events</a> property they will be delegated or bound by <strong>init</strong></strong></p>
    <p>Note: The <strong>init</strong> method of the basic type is definitely something you might wan to execute in in the scope of the descendant controllers.</p>
    <h3>params (examples)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>model:</strong> Model for the controller.</li>
        <li><strong>view:</strong> View for the controller.</li>
        <li><strong>el:</strong> The root of the dom part that the controller controls. Block controllers must be always passed with this</li>
        <li><strong>any other</strong> Any other argument will be automatically entered into the model</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>returns</h3>
    <p>The context controller</p>
    <h3>example usage</h3>
    <pre>
    (function (Zonzabone) {

        // Block controller, someData will be wrapped up in a basic model, el will be wrapped up in a basic view unless you define custom view and/or custom model.
        // Then you have pass this "el" and "someData" manually
        // Note: Preferably block controllers are loaded with <a href="#load_blocks">loadBlock</a>
        var blockContr = Zonzabone.controller({ "el": $('.css_path_to a _dom_el').get(0), "someData": { "key": "value" } });

        // Plain controller, custom view and model are passed to init. Also you can define them inside the controller
        var plainContr = Zonzabone.controller({ "model": custom_model_factory({ "key": "value" }), "view": custom_view_factory("el": $('.css_path_to a _dom_el').get(0)) });

    }(Zonzabone))

<article id="load_blocks">
    <h2>loadBlocks <span>(method)</span></h2>
    <code>controller.loadBlocks(broker, parent)</code>
    <p>Loads the first level blocks under its area.
        Second, third etc blocks needed to be loaded by their direct parent controller.
        To decide if a block is first-level or not <strong>findClosest</strong> will be used.
        Please note that <strong>loadBlocks</strong> works only for block controllers.
        Which means a piece of dom should be passed to the factory as a parameter(el)</p>
    <h3>params</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>broker:</strong> Reference to event broker. Note: Broker should be a singleton so this has to be really a reference (The root controller will create the broker originally)</li>
        <li><strong>parent:</strong> Reference to loader controller. Note: Using this reference the blocks on the same level can exchange information firing custom event on their common parent.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>returns</h3>
    <p>The context controller</p>
    <h3>example usage</h3>
    <pre>
    (function (NS, Zonzabone, options) {

        var that = Object.create(Zonzabone.controller(options)),
            broker = events();

        that.init = function (options) {
            this.getProto().init.bind(this)(options);

            return this.loadBlocks(broker, this);
        };

        NS.controller = that.init();
    }(NS, Zonzabone, options))
    </pre>
</article>
<article id="events">
    <h2>events <span>(property)</span></h2>
    <code>controller.events</code>
    <p>!!!This works only if you passed a dom element as a parameter (el).!!! So Probably your controller is a block controller.
        The <strong>events</strong> is a javascript object which describes browser events to delegate. Note: You must understand the difference between event delegation and event binding.
        The init function of the super factory (controller.js) will read this object so if you want these events to get delegated you have to execute the init function of the super factory (controller.js) in the sub factory.
        - Most probably in the init function.</p>
    <h3>type</h3>
    <p>object</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <strong>key</strong> of the object member should be the browser event and css path you want to delegate to.
            - Exactly like Backbone. Note that if you don't specify a css path you will bind the event to the root element of the block controller</li>
        <li><strong>handler</strong>: What you describe in <strong>handler</strong> will handle the event when it happens</li>
        <li><strong>ctx</strong>: !!!optional!!! What you describe in <strong>ctx</strong> will be used as a scope for the handler. If you don't specify this the current scope will be used instead</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>example usage</h3>
    <pre>
    contr.events = { "click .some-css-class": { "handler": contr.view.clickHandler, "ctx": contr.view } }
    </pre>
</article>
<article id="push">
    <h2>push <span>(method)</span></h2>
    <code>controller.push(url, state)</code>
    <p>This pushes the browser history. - Implemented because every controller must be able to do this</p>
    <h3>params</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>url:</strong> The state object is a JavaScript object which is associated with the new history entry created by pushState().
            Whenever the user navigates to the new state, a popstate event is fired, and the state property of the event contains a copy of the history entry's state object.</li>
        <li><strong>state:</strong> The new history entry's URL is given by this parameter. Note that the browser won't attempt to load this URL after a call to pushState(),
            but it might attempt to load the URL later, for instance after the user restarts her browser. The new URL does not need to be absolute; if it's relative,
            it's resolved relative to the current URL. The new URL must be of the same origin as the current URL; otherwise, pushState() will throw an exception.
            This parameter is optional; if it isn't specified, it's set to the document's current URL.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>returns</h3>
    <p>Nothing</p>
    <h3>example usage</h3>
    <pre>
    (function (NS, Zonzabone, options) {

        var that = Zonzabone.controller(options)

        that.someMethod = function () {

            // some other functionality

</article>
<article id="options">
    <h2>options <span>(property)</span></h2>
    <code>controller.options</code>
    <p>The initial options with that the controller was created.</p>
    <h3>type</h3>
    <p>Object</p>
</article>
<article id="teardown">
    <h2>teardown <span>(method)</span></h2>
    <code>controller.teardown()</code>
    <p>Undelegates the browser events and tears down the views of the controller. Unfortunately only collection of views can be properly destroyed.
        I.e. It will fail on a view with sub-views.</p>
    <h3>returns</h3>
    <p>Nothing</p>

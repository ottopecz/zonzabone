    <h1>Zonzabone</h1>
    <article>
        <p>Zonzabone is a javascript framework which is tailored to satisfy the needs of zadar/zonza+. Instead of writing an essay about the beauty of it, it might better to create a short list of the features and characteristics. </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Domain specific</strong> - Zonzabone was created to support one particular product.</li>
            <li><strong>Mid level</strong> - most of the mature frameworks (e.g. Backbone, Angular) have something for developers of any level of skill. With Zonzabone you have to be a capable javascript developer to utilise the library effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Traditional MVC</strong> - due to the domain-specificity, Zonzabone is great with traditional MVC. However this means that Zonzabone is only of help if you want to create controller heavy apps/miniapp/widgets.
                Apart from that you can be very flexible with architecture. Like:
                <ul>
                    <li>controller with one view</li>
                    <li>controller with a collection of views</li>
                    <li>controller with one view which has sub-views</li>
                    <li>controller with sub-controllers and individual views</li>
                    <li>etc</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Not so traditional MVC</strong> - Ok this was under the belt. The truth is the views are able to render templates. So the actual design pattern is more like MVCVM</li>
            <li><strong>Backbone inspired</strong> - you can see some Backbone-inspired features are implemented, but besides those, Zonzabone might be quite different. It lacks the 'ease' of Backbone, and great documentation (unfortunately) but most importantly you will never end up writing heavy, smart-head views. Hopefully...</li>
            <li><strong>Spooky</strong> - 95% of js apps out there use constructor functions and try to mimic classes to implement characteristics of object-oriented programming. Not like Zonzabone.
                The actual implementation is a customized, mixed version of the functional and prototypal inheritance pattern published by Douglas Crockford in Good Parts. Thanks Boss.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool</strong></li>
        </ol>

    <h1>Zonzabone</h1>
    <article>
        <p>Zonzabone is a javascript framework which is tailored to satisfy the needs of zadar/zonza+. Instead of writing an essay about the beauty of it I think it's better to create a short list of the features and characteristics. </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Domain specific.</strong> It was created to support one particular product.</li>
            <li><strong>Mid level.</strong> Most of the mature frameworks has something for developers on any level. With Zonzabone you have to be a medium level genuine javascript developer to use it effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Traditional MVC</strong> Because of it's domain-specificness and tailoredness Zonzabone is great with traditional MVC. However this only means that Zonzabone is a big help if you want to create controller heavy apps/miniapp/widgets.
                Apart from that you can be very flexible with architecture. Like:
                <ul>
                    <li>controller with one view</li>
                    <li>controller with a collection of views</li>
                    <li>controller with one view which has sub-views</li>
                    <li>controller with sub-controllers and each of them has a view</li>
                    <li>etc</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>No so traditional MVC</strong> Ok this was under the belt. The truth is the views are able to render templates. So the real design patterns is like MVCVM</li>
            <li><strong>Backbone inspired</strong> As you can see some of Backbone feature are implemented. But besides them Zonzabone might be quite different. Like it lacks of the "easiness" of Backbone.
                And the great documentation unfortunately. But most importantly you will never end up writing heavy, smart-head views. Hopefully...</li>
            <li><strong>Spooky</strong> 95% of js apps out there use constructor functions and try to mimic classes to implement characteristics of object-oriented programming. Not like Zonzabone.
                The actual implementation is a customized, cross-overed version of the functional and prototypal inheritance pattern published by Douglas Crockford in Good Parts. Thanks Boss.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool</strong></li>
        </ol>
